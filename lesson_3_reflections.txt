When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  To make the project open source and other contributors can add value to the project
  A backup away from the local machine
  Centralized place to access projects from anywhere
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pull to local repository only the commit required and if done automatically it can overwrite the code which I am working on
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are clones made by GitHub and has to be cloned manually to local repository
	Clones are copying remote repository to lcoal repository
	Branches are within the local repository where commits are made with the branch labels
